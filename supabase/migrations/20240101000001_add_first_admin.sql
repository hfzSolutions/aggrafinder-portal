-- This is a template script to add the first admin user
-- You should replace 'your-user-id' with your actual Supabase user ID
-- To find your user ID, go to the Supabase dashboard > Authentication > Users

-- Uncomment and modify the line below to add yourself as an admin
-- INSERT INTO public.admin_users (user_id) VALUES ('your-user-id');

-- Note: Since this is the first admin user, you'll need to execute this manually
-- in the Supabase SQL Editor after applying the create_admin_users migration.
